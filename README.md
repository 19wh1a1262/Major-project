# Aim of the project
Aim of the project is to help the people in there health fitness by finding number of steps they have walked or run. The shoes will be designed in such a way that anyone who does running or walking by wearing these uniquely designed Shoe they will get to know how many steps they have walked and if the person sit ideal for sometime then he get a notification to warm up and if he do over exercise he get a notification to rest for a while. And there will be also a water remainder to help the user to avoid dehydration. And the project also consists of GPS location tracking so that if the user went for a walk or run then the concerned people can track him.

# Problem Definition
Development of a prototype called “Smart Shoe for Health Fitness using IoT” which is designed in a unique wearable device to help the people in there health fitness by monitoring step count, avoiding dehydration and helping them from over exercise and tracking there whereabouts.

# Proposed System
The Proposed system is used for finding number of steps they have walked or run by using ultrasonic sensor and mems sensor. The shoes will be designed in such a way that anyone who does running or walking by wearing these uniquely designed shoe they will get to know how many steps they have walked and if the person sit ideal for sometime then he get a notification to warm up and if he do over exercise he get a notification to rest for a while through LCD display. And there will be also a water remainder to help the user to avoid dehydration. And the proposed system also consists of GPS location tracking using GPS sensor so that if the user went for a walk or run then the concerned people can track him.

# working
Once the system gets on i.e: once the person weared shoe then the moment will be detected by the mems sensor which is also called accelerometer. And the moment is detected then the shoe is capable of taking step count with the help of ultrasonic sensor. When the distance between the shoe and ground is less than 5 then it take it as step count. so when the person lifted his leg and touches the ground the step count will be taken. 
==> Once the step count is greater than 10 the user will get a message in the form of SMS "Rest for a while" with the help of GSM module. 
==> For every 30 seconds water remainder message will be send to user to avoid dehydration.
==> After the user taken rest and if he is not working for 10 min then to remaind him to do workout the user will get "Warmup" message. For our understanding we given 60 seconds instead of 10 min.
==> After the system gets on the GPS location will be send to the concerned people. So that they can track the user live location.
